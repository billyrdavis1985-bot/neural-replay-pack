# neural-replay-pack
**Neural Replay Pack** is an experimental neural memory bridge designed to capture, persist, and replay LLM failures, divergences, and nondeterministic behaviors as reusable artifacts.  This project was built through **14+ hours of continuous iterative development**, bringing together **four different LLMs**
